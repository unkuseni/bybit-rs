/// Represents the side of an order in trading, either buying or selling.

/// In financial markets, the "side" of an order indicates whether the trader is
/// purchasing (Buy) or selling (Sell) an asset. For perpetual futures on Bybit,
/// this determines whether the trader is opening a long position (Buy) or a short
/// position (Sell). When writing trading bots, the side is critical for position
/// management, as it affects margin requirements and exposure to price movements.
/// For example, a Buy order in a rising market aims to profit from price increases,
/// while a Sell order in a falling market aims to profit from price declines.
/// Incorrectly setting the side can lead to unintended positions, so bots must
/// validate this field against their strategy.
